    <p>Oil on panel <br>
    Overall: 36.8 x 58.4 cm (<em>14 1/2 x 23 in.</em>)
    Framed: 50.2 x 72.4 x 6.7 cm (<em>19 3/4 x 28 1/2 x 2 5/8 in.</em>)

  By the mid-seventeenth century the Dutch were the greatest sea power in the world. Their ships dominated the oceans, ensuring not only the military security of the Republic but also its prosperity. Indeed, the          combination of regional and global trade brought everything from exotic spices to bulk staples, such as grain and salt, to the Dutch ports. Simon de Vlieger's most innovative paintings, including this Estuary at        Day’s End, capture the flavour of daily life along the Dutch coast. In this restrained and sensitive composition, two workers apply tar to the hull of a ship resting on a sandbar at low tide. Black smoke from the fire that heats the tar rises up toward the towering clouds.</p>
